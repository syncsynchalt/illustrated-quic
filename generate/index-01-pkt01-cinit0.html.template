    <p>The connection begins with the client generating a private/public keypair
    for key exchange.  Key exchange is a technique
    where two parties can agree on the same number without
    an eavesdropper being able to tell what the number is.
    <p>
    An explanation of the key exchange can be found on my
    <a href="https://x25519.xargs.org/">X25519 site</a>,
    but doesn't need to be understood in depth for the rest
    of this page.
    <p>
    The private key is chosen by selecting an integer between
    0 and 2<sup>256</sup>-1.  The client does this by generating 32
    bytes (256 bits) of random data.  The
    <a href="files/client-ephemeral-private.key" download="client-ephemeral-private.key">private key</a>
    selected is:

    <pre class="ind2"><xtt class="longboi"

    The <a href="files/client-ephemeral-public.key" download="client-ephemeral-public.key">public key</a>
    is created from the private key as explained on the <a href="https://x25519.xargs.org/">X25519 site</a>.
    The public key calculated is:

    <pre class="ind2"><xtt class="longboi"

    The public key calculation can be confirmed at the command line:
    <codesample>

    Next, the client continues to prepare for the connection by generating
    the encryption keys for the Initial packets.
    Because key exchange between client and server has
    not taken place there is limited security in these keys -
    any observer can derive the keys and read the traffic like the server will.
    Encrypting the Initial packets prevents certain kinds of attacks
    such as request forgery attacks.
    <br><br>
    The client begins by generating 8 bytes of random data,
    in this case the bytes:
    <pre class="ind2"><xtt class="longboi">0001020304050607</xtt></pre>
    The client then derives encryption keys using the following process:

    <processblock>
<pre>initial_salt = 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a
initial_random = (random bytes from client given above)
initial_secret = HKDF-Extract(salt: initial_salt, key: initial_random)
client_secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: initial_secret, label: "client in", ctx: "", len: 32)
server_secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: initial_secret, label: "server in", ctx: "", len: 32)
client_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: client_secret, label: "quic key", ctx: "", len: 16)
server_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: server_secret, label: "quic key", ctx: "", len: 16)
client_iv = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: client_secret, label: "quic iv", ctx: "", len: 12)
server_iv = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: server_secret, label: "quic iv", ctx: "", len: 12)
client_hp_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: client_secret, label: "quic hp", ctx: "", len: 16)
server_hp_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(key: server_secret, label: "quic hp", ctx: "", len: 16)
</pre>
    </processblock>

    The use of the magic constant "<xtt>38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a</xtt>" as the initial
    salt is interesting, as it is not derived from mathematical constants or cryptographic
    principles. It's the value of the first SHA-1 collision, co-discovered by Google researchers
    (QUIC itself was initially created, sponsored, and deployed by Google).

    <br><br>

    This has introduced two new cryptographic concepts from TLS 1.3:
    <ul>
    <li><xtt>HKDF-Extract</xtt> - given a salt and some bytes of key material
    create 256 bits (32 bytes) of new key material, with the
    input key material's entropy evenly distributed in the
    output.
    <li><xtt>HKDF-Expand-Label</xtt> - given the inputs of key
    material, label, and context data, create a new key of the
    requested length.
    </ul>

    I've created <a href="files/hkdf.sh" download="hkdf">an HKDF tool</a>
    to perform HKDF operations on the command line.
    The key derivation process is reproduced at the command line below:
    <codesample>
<pre><code>$ init_salt=38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a
$ init_dcid=0001020304050607
$ init_secret=$(./hkdf extract $init_salt $init_dcid)
$ csecret=$(./hkdf expandlabel $init_secret "client in" "" 32)
$ ssecret=$(./hkdf expandlabel $init_secret "server in" "" 32)
$ client_init_key=$(./hkdf expandlabel $csecret "quic key" "" 16)
$ server_init_key=$(./hkdf expandlabel $ssecret "quic key" "" 16)
$ client_init_iv=$(./hkdf expandlabel $csecret "quic iv" "" 12)

$ client_init_hp=$(./hkdf expandlabel $csecret "quic hp" "" 16)
$ server_init_hp=$(./hkdf expandlabel $ssecret "quic hp" "" 16)
$ echo ckey: $client_init_key
$ echo civ: $client_init_iv
$ echo chp: $client_init_hp
$ echo skey: $server_init_key
$ echo siv: $server_init_iv

</code></pre>
    </codesample>

    From this we get the following encryption keys and IVs:
    <ul>
    <li>client initial key: <xtt class="longboi">b14b918124fda5c8d79847602fa3520b</xtt>
    <li>client initial IV: <xtt class="longboi">ddbc15dea80925a55686a7df</xtt>
    <li>server initial key: <xtt class="longboi">d77fc4056fcfa32bd1302469ee6ebf90</xtt>
    <li>server initial IV: <xtt class="longboi">fcb748e37ff79860faa07477</xtt>
    </ul>
    We also get the following "header protection keys", which will be explained below:
    <ul>
    <li>client initial header protection key: <xtt class="longboi">6df4e9d737cdf714711d7c617ee82981</xtt>
    <li>server initial header protection key: <xtt class="longboi">440b2725e91dc79b370711ef792faa3d</xtt>
    </ul>
    At this point there is still no data sent over the network. The first data is sent below.

            The packet begins with a header byte, which has header protection
            applied.  Header protection is used to hide packet numbers and other
            information from outside observers.
            <br><br>
            Header protection is applied by encrypting a sample of each packet's
            payload with the "header protection key", then XOR'ing certain bits
            and bytes in each packet with the resulting data. For "long" format
            packets such as this one, the protected sections are the lower 4 bits
            of this byte, and the bytes of the Packet Number (seen later).
            <br><br>
            An example of how to compute header protection:
            <codesample>
<pre><code>### "client header protection key" from calc step above
$ key=6df4e9d737cdf714711d7c617ee82981
### sample is taken from 16 bytes of payload starting
### 4 bytes past the first byte of the packet number
$ sample=ed78716be9711ba498b7ed868443bb2e
$ echo $sample | xxd -r -p | openssl aes-128-ecb -K $key | head -c 5 | xxd -p

ed9895bb15

### first byte of result is xor'd into lower 4 bits of this byte,
### remaining bytes are xor'd one-for-one into the bytes of
### the packet number (which in this packet is only one byte)

            This data is also potentially truncated. The

            the highest packet number sent and the lowest
            unacknowledged packet number, doubles that
            spread for safety, rounds up, then figures the
            number of bytes it can remove from the high
            bits of the packet number to unambiguously
            represent a number between those two ends. The
            encoded packet number is then truncated to that
            number of bytes, and the receiving endpoint
            fills in the full number based on the packet
            numbers it has most recently seen. Because our
            example conversation sends so few packets (fewer
            than 64), this truncation won't occur in this

            The unusual version number ("3,3" representing
            TLS 1.2) is due to TLS 1.0 being a minor
            revision of the SSL 3.0 protocol.  Therefore
            TLS 1.0 is represented by "3,1", TLS 1.1 is
            "3,2", and so on.

    Any datagram sent by the client that contains an Initial packet
    must be padded to a length of 1200 bytes. This library does it
    by appending nul bytes to the datagram.

            Padding this packet to a size of 1200 bytes serves two purposes:
            <ul>

            <li><b>Path MTU validation</b> - Any IPv4 host or
            router is allowed to drop packets
            that exceed their MTU limit, to a minimum of
            576 bytes. The vast majority of the internet
            has a much higher MTU (typically 1500 bytes). A higher
            packet size will increase throughput and
            performance. Given these realities QUIC chooses
            a minimum size constraint of 1200 bytes, which
            should traverse the vast majority of real
            networks (including tunneled networks)
            without being dropped for size.
            <br>
            To prevent a scenario where a connection is established
            successfully with smaller packets but then starts timing out
            once larger packets are sent, the initial packets are
            padded to a length of 1200 bytes to prove that the
            end-to-end path will allow packets of that size.

            <li><b>Amplification Attack Mitigation</b> - There is a class
            of network attack in which an attacker
            can send a small amount of traffic to an innocent third party
            which replies with a much larger amount of traffic directed
            at the target. In the case of QUIC this could be done with
            IP address spoofing, and would cause QUIC servers to reply
            to small Initial datagrams with much larger Handshake responses.
            <br>
            To help mitigate this, QUIC servers are forbidden from replying to a
            client with more than 3 times the traffic that was sent to it,
            until the server has received some proof from the client that
            it's at the given address (such as round-trip data originally from the server).
            Adding padding to this Initial datagram gives the server a "byte budget"
            to perform handshake responses without exceeding this 3x limit.
