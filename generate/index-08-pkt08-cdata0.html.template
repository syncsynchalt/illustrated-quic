            The packet begins with a header byte, which has header protection
            applied.  Header protection is used to hide packet numbers and other
            information from outside observers.
            <br><br>
            Header protection is applied by encrypting a sample of each packet's
            payload with the "header protection key", then XOR'ing certain bits
            and bytes in each packet with the resulting data. For "short" format
            packets such as this one, the protected sections are the lower 5 bits
            of this byte, and the bytes of the Packet Number (seen later).
            <br><br>
            An example of how to compute header protection:
            <codesample>
<pre><code>### "client header protection key" from application keys calc step above
$ key=8a6a38bc5cc40cb482a254dac68c9d2f
### sample is taken from 16 bytes of payload starting
### 4 bytes past the first byte of the packet number
$ sample=e66e8ee950ba8b8ed10cba39a06ab7b0
$ echo $sample | xxd -r -p | openssl aes-128-ecb -K $key | head -c 5 | xxd -p

4e1e62a65d

### first byte of result is xor'd into lower 5 bits of this byte,
### remaining bytes are xor'd one-for-one into the bytes of
### the packet number (which in this packet is only one byte)
</code></pre>
            </codesample>
            The bits in the unprotected byte 0x40 have the following meaning:
            <table class="bits">
            <thead><tr>
              <th></th>

            The destination connection ID is given. This field

            connection.
            <br><br>
            Note that the connection ID length is not given. The peer
            must know the length, either by always using the same length,

            This byte has header protection applied, see Packet Header Byte for
            details.
            <br><br>
            This byte has the unprotected value of 0x00, indicating it is packet
            0, or the first "Application" packet sent by the client.

            This data is also potentially truncated. The
            sending endpoint calculates the spread between
            the highest packet number sent and the lowest
            unacknowledged packet number, doubles that
            spread for safety, rounds up, then figures the
            number of bytes it can remove from the high
            bits of the packet number to unambiguously
            represent a number between those two ends. The
            encoded packet number is then truncated to that
            number of bytes, and the receiving endpoint
            fills in the full number based on the packet
            numbers it has most recently seen. Because our
            example conversation sends so few packets (fewer
            than 64), this truncation won't occur in this
            document.  See <a
            href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-17.1">RFC

            The client indicates it is sending data with a "STREAM" frame. Streams are the mechanism for
            all application data sent in a QUIC connection, and are analogous to an individual TCP connection.
            <br><br>
            The frame type is a number
            in the range 0x8 through 0xf (in binary: 0b00001xxx) with the variable bits acting as flags
            that give additional information about the stream frame:
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>

            <tr><td>0x1</td><td>FIN: This frame contains the final data of this stream, and the sender is done writing to it</td>
            </table>
            In this case, the sender indicates all three: there
            will be an offset field, a length field, and this
            is the final data for this stream.
